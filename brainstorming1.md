                <li><strong>What is this app for?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>This app gives users quick recipe given whatever they have at their disposal. It gives an organized and simple UI to look at and manage their foodie desires.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Who is this app for?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is app for those who have trouble knowing what to make for their meals, or who are tired of the same old basic meals everytime.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Why are we building this app?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    We are building this app, mainly for the reason that some of us have trouble deciding on what to make when you have the same things in the fridge all the time. For example, you want eggs in the morning, but are tired of just boiling or frying it. What can we do with that egg? So much potential.</li>
                    </ul></li>
                <li><strong>What are some potential challenges?</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some potential challenges in developing this app would be the learning curve obviously, and as well as the competition it would have in the market if it were to ever get released-- since this isn't a ground-breaking original idea. This app would serve to benefit us in the way that it helps develop software development skills as well as just having something for us to present on our skillset.</li>
